# JS Algorithms with Jest testing and Node

These algorithms are provided as examples if you have an upcoming JavaScript coding interview. The examples will start with simple examples and then get more challenging. We will cover algorithms and then Data Structures. The main goal of these examples is to have an idea of what some of the coding interview questions may be so that you can focus on the more relevant information of working at a tech company.

## Requirements

The coding editor is a matter of personal preference but I will be using VSCode to work through problems.

The needed extensions using VSCode are:

- Code Runner to run the code
- Jest tests to ensure the tests are passing

Alternatively you can also run these in the dev console of a browser you are comfortable with:

- All that is needed is to add a new script then run the code

## Testing with Jest:

- To setup Jest tests in your own repo do the following steps in order below
  - Create a new repo, and then run `npm init` from the terminal and add the needed information
  - Next run `npm i jest-cli -g` if you don't have it installed
  - Any test file ensure that it is formatted in `filename.test.js` then navigate to respective directory
  - Run `npm test filename.test.js` and it will pass or fail
  - This is optional and you can just as easily just run the original file with the `code runner` extension
